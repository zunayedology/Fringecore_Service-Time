# Service Time

I watched the entire video and found a pixel where all the customers stood to be served. When a customer arrives in front of the table, the pixel color changes. I used this information to calculate the service time of each customer. I used the OpenCV library to read the video and calculate the service time and finally show the average. 

**This method will only work for the particular video provided in the repository.**
